this is a try at ray rtracing using vulkan/c++ but currently i have incountered an issue when the ssbo's are uploaded to the shader the data is wrong (corrupted)
it will be nice if i get help so this is a cry for help.

you will need to set up glm & glfw & vulkan (i used absalut linking for this so you will need to link it your self sorry for that).
